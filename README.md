# LeapYearTest_oblig3
- This is quick documentation of what I have done in oblig_3:
  - Got help from a former SE-student to setup maven supported repo.
  - Then created a workflow that makes it possible to run tests and show results of the tests in a log
  - After the setup, I cloned the repo using Github Desktop to connect the project to github repo.
  - After cloning and connectiong I commited & pushed the files of my project (oblig 2-folder).
  - The last thing i did was commit the tests and check if they run i Github Actions, and they did successfully :)
  - And done ;)
